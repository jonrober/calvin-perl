libcalvin-perl (1.00-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Jon Robertson ]
  * First debian build of Calvin libraries.

  [ Russ Allbery ]
  * Add myself to Uploaders.
  * Rewrite debian/copyright to apply to this package.
  * Switch to the DEP-14 branch layout and add debian/gbp.conf to
    configure git-buildpackage to use it automatically.
  * Update debhelper compatibility mode to V11.
    - Add ${misc:Depends} to dependencies.
  * Move perl to Build-Depends, since Build-Depends-Indep isn't meaningful
    for a source package that only builds arch-all binary packages.
  * Run wrap-and-sort -ast.
