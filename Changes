                     User-Visible Net::Calvin Changes

Net::Calvin 1.00 (2018-01-07)

    First semi-public release of various Perl modules for logging and log
    searching for Calvin chatservers.  This uses the Calvin distribution
    name because all the modules are still rooted in Calvin, but this
    should change to Net::Calvin in a later release.
