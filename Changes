                     User-Visible Net::Calvin Changes

Net::Calvin 1.04 (2018-04-22)

    Switch to Module::Build for the build system.  As a side effect, this
    will install the manual pages for the things that have POD
    documentation.

    Fix Bots to ignore undef given to the setters.  The config loading was
    wiping out defaults when config options were missing, because config
    loading was then calling setters with undef.

    Fix syntax errors in URL_Store.pm (not currently used).

    Remove unnecessary use of Crypt in Calvin::Bots::INroll.

    Add a basic test that all modules pass syntax checks.

Net::Calvin 1.03 (2018-03-17)

    Added perldoc for logread, logfind, and loggrep.

    logread: Save errors file to the running user's home directory.

    Cambot.pm: Fix errors when Cambot is run by users who don't have all of
    the same things set as a system bot does, such as autojoins.

    logfind: Add script to search logs by tags.

Net::Calvin 1.02 (2018-01-26)

    uberbot: Move to use yaml config files, and rewrite config file handling
    to no longer use internal strings that we create and reparse.  These only
    existed to allow creating new bots from existing bots, which we don't
    actually use, and which complicates the logic for no reason.

    uberbot: Redo STDERR handling to only redirect it to a file if a filename
    is given as an argument with --error=<fname>.  This will let the main
    system uberbot send errors to normal system logs.

    uberbot-config-upgrade: New script to rewrite existing uberbot config files
    to the yaml format uberbot now expects.

    Clean up command names in plexchar-* documentation and help.

    plexchar-search: Run help if no arguments are given.

    Tag.pm: Fix use of a testing directory for $ROOTDIR.

    Added Calvin::Bots::Characters, a new bot that provides plexchar-search
    read-only functionality as a bot.

Net::Calvin 1.01 (2018-01-15)

    Cambot: Move all session-list-* commands into just session-list with a
    number of arguments that are parsed by Getopt::Long.

    Cambot: Add new session-list commands for searching based on whether a
    session has been used for logging or not yet.

    uberbot: Adjust hardcoded location of the error file from a specific user
    directory to the current user home directory.

Net::Calvin 1.00 (2018-01-07)

    First semi-public release of various Perl modules for logging and log
    searching for Calvin chatservers.  This uses the Calvin distribution
    name because all the modules are still rooted in Calvin, but this
    should change to Net::Calvin in a later release.
