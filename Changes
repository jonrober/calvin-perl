                     User-Visible Net::Calvin Changes

Net::Calvin 1.00 (2018-01-07)

    First semi-public release of various Perl modules for logging and log
    searching for Calvin chatservers.  This uses the Calvin distribution
    name because all the modules are still rooted in Calvin, but this
    should change to Net::Calvin in a later release.

Net::Calvin 1.01 (2018-01-14)

    Cambot: Move all session-list-* commands into just session-list with a
    number of arguments that are parsed by Getopt::Long.

    Cambot: Add new session-list commands for searching based on whether a
    session has been used for logging or not yet.

    uberbot: Adjust hardcoded location of the error file from a specific user
    directory to the current user home directory.
